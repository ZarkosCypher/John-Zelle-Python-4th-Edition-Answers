# John-Zelle-Python-4th-Edition-Answers
This is a Place Where I put all my code for the John Zelle 4th edition Programing answers. just an FYI I have programed with python maybe 7 years ago so i may use certan functions that have not been talked about in the chapter. Also i am doing this for college so i will leave notes for ones i got wrong, and maybe one day in the future fix them.
