# John-Zelle-Python-4th-Edition-Answers  John Zelle Python Programming Answers 4th edition
This repository has all my solutions to the Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science book by John Zelle.

This project contains solutions to the exercises found in the textbook, Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, Fourth Edition.

I put all my code for the John Zelle 4th edition Programming answers, as well as pictures of the questions directly from the book. Just an FYI, I programmed with Python maybe 7 years ago, so I may use certain functions that have not been talked about in the chapter. Also, I am doing this for college, so I will leave notes for ones I got wrong and maybe one day fix them. 
You can access his books and example code as well: https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/
And you can purchase his book off of Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1590282973

!!!Also, I used an image to text program for the text files so it will be comeout broken for the chapter questions .txt files, i may or may not go back one day and fix them. this is alot of work i am doing for fre,e and I don't have that much time. So if you want anything fixed, send a commit request and I will push it through!!!
